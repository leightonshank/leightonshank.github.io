After installing Debian 'wheezy' using crouton (needs link), installed these packages:

-  git
-  vim
-  gcc
-  make

Also installed rbenv (needs link) and ruby-build (needs link).



On Chromebook itself just did the 'dev_install', and then:

-  tmux

Base dev_install will give you 'python' as a language within Chrome OS itself.  ALso
installed Go, since Google made it pretty simple to install within Chrome OS.
