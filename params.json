I spend my days hacking code and running the development team for (Getloaded)[http://getloaded.com], a load board for the transportation industry.  We help truckers find loads to carry, and help brokers find trucks to carry their loads.  When I'm not working I enjoy cycling, playing guitar, riding motorcycles, and spending time with my family.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more info to come...\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n#TODO Add page content.\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-50990678-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
